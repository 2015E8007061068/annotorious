# Annotorious - Image Annotation for the Web

This is an Open Source effort to port the [yuma.js](http://yuma-js.github.com) image annotation toolkit to JavaScript, improving things as we go along. Online demos are available [here (for the standalone version)](http://yuma-js.github.com/yuma2.html) and [here (for the Annotator plugin)](http://yuma-js.github.com/okfn_plugin.html).

## Getting Started

Instructions on getting started using Annotorious on your own Web pages are [on the Wiki](annotorious/wiki/Getting-Started). Instructions on using it as a plugin to the [Annotator](http://okfnlabs.org/annotator/) Web annotation system are [here](annotorious/wiki/Annotator-Plugin). If you require professional support, or have special integration or feature requirements, you are welcome to [contact us directly](mailto:rainer.simon@ait.ac.at).
