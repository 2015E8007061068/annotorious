This is an effort to port the "yuma.js":http://yuma-js.github.com image annotation toolkit to JavaScript, improving things as we go along. Any help appreciated! I'm putting up live demos of the intermediate state as we progress:

h2. Using

To make images on your Website annotatable with this library, follow these steps:

*Include the library JavaScript* file in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page

<pre>
<code>
<head>
  ...
  <script type="text/javascript" src="yuma2.min.js"></script>
  ...
</head>
</code>
</pre>

*Include the library CSS stylesheet* in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page

<pre>
<code>
<head>
   ...
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/yuma2.css" />
   <script type="text/javascript" src="yuma2.min.js"></script>
   ...
 </head>  
</code>
</pre>

*Use the library JavaScript API* to attach annotation functionality to images on your page.

<pre>
<code>
<head>
  ...
  <script type="text/javascript">
    new ImageAnnotator('annotateme');
  </script>
</head>

That's it. (Note: we might make this even easier in the future using CSS-class based selection...)

<body>
  ...
  <img id="annotateme" src="myimage.jpg">
  ...
</body>
</code>
</pre>

h2. Developing

We're using Google's "Closure Tools":http://developers.google.com/closure/. I recommend using the "plovr":http://plovr.com/ build tool to get started quickly.

* Run <code>java -jar plovr/plovr.jar serve annotator.json</code> in the working directory 
* Open <code>index.html</code> in your browser - and code away
* To build the minified JavaScript, run <code>java -jar plovr/plovr.jar build annotator.json > yuma2.min.js</code> (replacing 'yuma2.min.js' with a file name of your choice)
* Note: the version of plovr I included in this repository is the February 2012 release ("plovr-4b3caf2b7d84.jar":http://code.google.com/p/plovr/downloads/detail?name=plovr-4b3caf2b7d84.jar&can=2).

h2. Upcoming Work/Todos (almost in order of priority...)

* Clean up namespacing (it's a bit messy after the last refactoring) 
* Re-think the overall workflow/usability (I'm thinking about alignin with the OKFN Annotator workflow - any comments welcome!)
* Custom mouseover/mouseout events for annotation shapes
* Popup annotation bubble
* Popup annotation create/edit form
* Attach storage according to "OKFN Annotator Store":http://github.com/okfn/annotator/wiki/Storage protocol
* OpenLayers and/or Seadragon AJAX support
* Optimization, optimization, optimization! (Code and runtime performance.)
* Implement POINT and POLYGON shape geometries
* Add support for the "toponym selection tool":http://github.com/rsimon/toponymotator
* *Find a decent name for this tool!*
